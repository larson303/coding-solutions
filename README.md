# Coding Solutions

I like to try to stay organized, really, I do.  But after setting up frameworks like Angular or Maven to compile and run various scenarios, I realized that sometimes, simple is better for reviewing a concept, so I created this repo for that situationâ€”simple, typically single-file solutions to things I want to review for interviews.  

Especially as someone who has done leadership and architecture, I typically know "what to do" but want to make snippets on "how to implement" as my data structures and algorithms class was long ago in college and, strangely enough, never came up in the companies I was working for unless I brought it up.  I used to get frustrated with architects who didn't seem to know how to code when I was a junior and mid-level programmer, and now I get it.  They are off solving either obscure issues, learning new frameworks, or, more commonly, trying to decode bureaucracy, such an unsolvable cryptogram that they even obscure the spelling to wave off the weak-hearted.
